    <h1>Some thoughts on Stoicism</h1>
    <h3>Marcus Aurelius: Meditations</h3>
    <p>Marcus Aurelius is one of the best known stoic philosophers, and his 'Meditations' is short, concise, and easily applicable to every day life.
    Since this book is actually his journal to himself the text is accessible and includes many thoughts that the reader can relate to.
    However, some readers may struggle be hestitant to try stoicism after reading Meditations because of the sometimes brutally rigorous way that Marcus Aurelius approached life, and how critical he was of himself.</p>
   
    <h3>Seneca: Letters from a Stoic</h3>
    <p>Letters from a Stoic by Seneca are considerably longer than Meditations, and include 124 letters that Seneca wrote to his friend Lucilius.
    The tone of the letters range from supportive to critical, as Seneca gives adivce to his friend, answers questions, and reflects on his own struggles to be a good stoic.
    Due to the nature of the letters I find that the advice is given much more kindly, and shows a more human approach to stoicism, which may be easier for readers newly interested in stoicism to implement.</p>
